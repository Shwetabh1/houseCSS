The method elem.getBoundingClientRect() returns window coordinates for elem as an object with properties:

top – Y-coordinate for the top element edge,
left – X-coordinate for the left element edge,
right – X-coordinate for the right element edge,
bottom – Y-coordinate for the bottom element edge.


It is relative to the window


Because it is absolute it is fixed to a position.
Will not move from there.

It is because getBoundingClientRect() gets values with respect to the window(only the current visible portion of the page), not the document(whole page).

myElement.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY;

The pageXOffset and pageYOffset properties returns the pixels the current document has been scrolled from the upper left corner of the window, horizontally and vertically.

The background-position property in CSS allows you to move a background image (or gradient) around within its container.

It has three different types of values:

Length values (e.g. 100px 5px)
Percentages (e.g. 100% 5%)
Keywords (e.g. top right)
