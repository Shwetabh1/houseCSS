###How do traingles work. It can be made via two approaches.

1. Using Border width
2. Using Tilting the Triangles.

How that works: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7073484/how-do-css-triangles-work
Example JS Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qvt59o7w/14/

Incase of Border Width each meet at 45 degree angles. We leverage that fact.

Also we can tilt the triangles and hide the overflow part. That would make it responsive as well. Yo!
