Cascade: what styles the browser will apply to html elements


There are three kinds of css
1. Given by browser : least precedence
User Agent Stylesheet: given by us: more precendence
Author stylesheet: <link> ..</link> most precedence

use !important to override any of it.

which will be applied?
p {
	background-color: red;
}

p {
	background-color:green;
}
the last one encountered;

<script style1.css>
<script style2.css> //this will be given more preference


//this is a csss file called styles1.css
@import url(styls2.css)

p {
	background-color:red;
}

whatever is encountered at end is given preference

Which rule is preferred in case of conflicts depends on the specificity. That's all there is to it.

2. ruleset: the selectors that are selected. (just like regex)
3. At-rules are used in CSS to convey metadata, conditional information, or other descriptive information.

The z-index CSS property specifies the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants. When elements overlap, z-order determines which one covers the other. An element with a larger z-index generally covers an element with a lower one.
