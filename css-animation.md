Remember the animation properties and then the keyframe function that is it

Long Hand Properties:
  animation-name: tutsFade;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-delay: 1s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
  animation-direction: alternate;

Short Hand Properties
animation: tutsFade 4s 1s infinite linear alternate;

What is the difference between transition and animation
Transitions for creating a smooth transition from one state to another, and animations for more complex series of movements.

Transitions are generally easier to create and manage, and apply to the majority of situations. If you need more control over animating an element through a series of steps, or if the animation needs to begin on load, then an animation with keyframes might be the better choice.
